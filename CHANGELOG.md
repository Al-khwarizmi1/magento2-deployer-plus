    * `/var/cache`
    * `/var/page_cache`
    * `/var/session`
* `maintenance:unset` during rollback

### Removed
* remove `var` dir from `shared_dirs` because `generated` and `view_preprocessed` should not be shared among releases. If not, we are changing the current generated code while building the new release.

### Added
* Execute `setup:upgrade` and `app:config:import` in no interaction mode

## [1.1] - 04-04-2018

* Remove `ci_branch` param as it is not used

## [1.0.7] - 04-04-2018
### Removed
* Sample configuration of `maintenance` and `cache` tasks only executed for master server. These tasks should be executed on all servers unless the `var` folder is shared among server instances

### Changed

## [1.0.2] - 21-03-2018

* Fix exclude `var/cache` and `var/page_cache` from artifact. Excluding `cache` was also excluding some module cache folders that are needed.

## [1.0.1] - 20-03-2018
### Changed
* Fix `crontab:update` step due to changes introduced on version 2.2.2
    * [https://github.com/magento/magento2/commit/79e9054aa2fd66a6c804774617cd0f5d14ffc49a](https://github.com/magento/magento2/commit/79e9054aa2fd66a6c804774617cd0f5d14ffc49a)

## [0.2] - 26-01-2018
### Added
* Task `cache:clear:magento`
